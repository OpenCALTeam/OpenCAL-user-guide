\section{Introduction}

This guide presents \verb"OpenCAL", an open source C/C++ library
for implementing models based on the Cellular Automata (CA)
paradighm. Specifically, the library was developed with the aim to permit a
straightforward and simple implementation of Cellular Automata models, which are
particularly suitable for the simulation of spatial extended dynamical systems.
Key features of \verb"OpenCAL" are the
following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Parallel and Multiplatform. 
    
    \item Support for GPU execution, using OpenCL and CUDA.
    
    \item Support for Complex Cellular Automata 
    
    \item Other Key features here 
\end{itemize}

\section{Structure of the Distribution Directory}

The distribution contains the following files and subdirectories:

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{AUTHORS}: Authors of \verb"libautoti".


\end{itemize}


\section{Requirements and dependencies}

To compile \verb"libautoti", you must have an ANSI C++ compiler
that includes a full implementation of the Standard Library and
related header files. Additionally, if you want to obtain a
parallel version of the library, you must have an implementation
of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for the parallel computer
or workstation network you are running on. If you do not have a
native version of MPI for your computer, several
machine-independent implementations are available. Most of the
testing and development of \verb"libautoti" was done by using the
MPICH2 implementation of MPI, which is freely available.
Additional information about MPICH2 is available on the World Wide
Web at \url{http://www.mcs.anl.gov/research/projects/mpich2/}.
