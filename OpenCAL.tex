\chapter{OpenCAL}

With the name OpenCAL, we identify the sequential version of the
software library, which runs on just a single core of your CPU. It
represents the basis for the other parallel versions. Moreover, it
allows for some unsafe operations, which can significantly speed up
your application, Such unsafe operation can also be found in the
OpenMP version buth they are not present to GPU side.

In the following sections, we will introduce OpenCAL by examples. At
the beginning we will deal with the safe part of OpenCAL, while at the
end we will go deep inside with the unsafe operations.
