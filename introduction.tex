\chapter{Introduction}

Cellular Automata (CA) represent a parallel computing methodology for
modelling complex systems. Well known examples of applications include
the simulation of natural phenomena such as lava and debris flows,
forest fires, agent based social processes such as pedestrian
evacuation and highway traffic problems, besides many others (e.g.,
theoretical studies).

Many Cellular Automata software environments and libraries exist.
However, when non-trivial modelling is needed, only non-open source
software are generally available. This is particularly true for
eXtended Cellular Automata (XCA), adopted for simulating phenomena at
a macroscopic point of view, for which only a significant example of
non free software exists, namely the CAMELot Cellular Automata
Simulation Environment.

In order to fill this deficiency in the world of free software, the
\verb'OpenCAL' C Library has been developed. Similarly to CAMELot, it
allows for a simple and concise definition of both the transition
function and the other characteristics of the cellular automaton
definition. Moreover, it allows for both sequential and parallel
execution, both on CPUs and GPUs (thanks to the adoption of the OpenMP
and OpenCL APIs, respectively), hiding most parallel implementation issues
to the user.

The library has been tested on both CPUs anf GPUs by considering
different Cellular Automata, including the well known Conway's Game of
Life and the SciddicaT XCA debris flows simulation model. Results have
demonstrated the goodness the library both in terms of usability and
performance.

In the present release 1.0 of the library, 2D and 3D cellular automata
can be defined\footnote{Indeed, even 1D CA can be defined oas a
  degenerate case of 2D, or even 3D, CA.}. The library also offers
diverse facilities (e.g. it provides many pre-defined cell's
neighborhoods), allows to explicate the simulation main cycle and
provides a built in optimization algorithm to speed up your
simulation. Moreover, OpenCAL offers you a built in interactive 2D/3D
visualization system you can use to graphically represent step by step
your simulation based. The visualization system was developed in
OpenGL Compatibility Profile, thus is able to run everywhere, also on
old workstations.

The present manual reports the main usage of the \verb'OpenCAL'
library related to the sequential, OpenMP and OpenCL versions, the
library installation procedure, besides diverse examples of
application. In particular, Chapter \ref{ch:installation} deals with
OpenCAL download and installation, while Chapter \ref{ch:CA} introduce
you to the CA and XCA computational paradigms. If you already know
theese topics, you can skip this Chapter. Chapter \ref{ch:opencal} is
about serial CA and XCA development with OpenCAL, and introduce the
different library features by examples. Chapter \ref{ch:opencal-omp}
is about the OpenMP-based parallel version of OpenCAL and also
introduces the library by examples. Chapter \ref{ch:opencal-cl}
briefly introduces you to General Purpose GPU programmin with OpenCL
and then presents you the OpenCL-based version of OpenCAL, still by
examples. OpenCAL-GL, whihch is the name that identifies the OpenGL
visualization system built into OpenCAL, is introduced at the end of
each of the above Chapters, together with computational performaces of
some of the implemented CA. Eventually, Chapter \ref{ch:utility} ends
this user guide by presenting you some usefull library features that
weren't presented previously, like reduction functions.
